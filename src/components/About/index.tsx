Back then, I worked with web designers to make featured news pages - turns out teaching me a lot about HTML & CSS and changed my career.`}</p>

                <p>To this day, {`I've had`} <span>{`7 years' experiences`}</span> as a web developer building <span>{"to B"} and {"to C"}</span> projects both on <span>desktop and mobile</span> for a variety of users. The main focus on my last job was building an accessible, inclusive admin dashboard for internal employees using <span>React, Redux, Typescript</span>, etc.</p>

                <p>Currently, I am self learning about <span>web3</span>, trying to integrate my previous knowledge into new things and making a difference. I alongside with my passion want to give myself a break to dive into this new area embracing uncertainty and possibility.</p>
